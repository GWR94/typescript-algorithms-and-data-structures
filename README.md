# **TypeScript Algorithms & Data Structures**

Algorithms and data structures built with TypeScript, including tests, commenting and challenges, completed during [this](https://www.udemy.com/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/) JavaScript algorithms & data structures Udemy course.

## **Algorithms**

The algorithms directory includes challenges and descriptions of a variety of algorithms, including recursion, searching algorithms and sorting algorithms. It also includes different strategies for solving algorithms, such as frequency counters, multiple pointers and sliding window techniques. All algorithms have their "Big O" notation explained in the comments, along with a description of what the algorithm is doing.

## Data Structures

// !TODO!

## Usage

- Access the repository by downloading the zip file, or clone it using the CLI by running `git clone https://github.com/jamesgower/typescript-algorithms-and-data-structures.git`
- Change to the directory where it was cloned/downloaded to
- Run `npm install`
- Execute each data structure or algorithm with `ts-node *dirname*`

## Tests

All tests are created using a combination of Jest and ts-jest.

- To run all of the test suites you can run `npm run t`.
- To run all of the tests with individual passing/failing test results, run `npm run test`.
