# Binary Heaps

Binary heaps are very similar to binary search trees, except they have some different rules. In a *max* binary heap, the parent node is always larger than the child nodes. In a *min* binary heap, the parent nodes are always smaller than the child nodes. Binary heaps can also have a maximum of 2 nodes as children, much like binary search trees.
