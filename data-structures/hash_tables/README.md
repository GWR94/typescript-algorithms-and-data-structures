# **Hash Tables**

A hash table is a data structure which stores key-value pairs, much like arrays, except that with hash tables the keys are not ordered. Unlike arrays, hash tables are fast for *all* of the following operations: finding values, adding new values, and removing values.

Almost every programming language has a hash table data structure pre-built in the language. Because of their speed, hash tables are very commonly used. For example, Python has Dictionaries; JavaScript has Objects and Maps; Java, Go & Scala have Maps, and Ruby has Hashes.
