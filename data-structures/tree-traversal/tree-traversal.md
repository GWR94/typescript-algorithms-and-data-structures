# Tree Traversal

Tree traversal is a method of looking at every node in any type of tree at least one time. There are so many different methods of traversing a tree, but there are two main strategies behind all of these methods - breadth-first search and depth-first search. The difference between the two are the general direction on how you do the search.

## Breadth-First Search

Breadth-first searching is where you start from the one particular node, and then going to a different "row" and check all nodes, then repeating on all of the "rows" until the whole tree have been checked.

## Depth-first Search

Depth-first searching is where you are going down vertically through the tree, and moving along "columns" and check all of those nodes, then repeating the process until all of the "columns" have been checked and all of the nodes have been visited.
